    "symptoms": "Bacterial blight starts out as angular, waxy and water-soaked leaf spot with a red to brown border on leaves, stems and bolls. The angular appearance is due to the restriction of the lesions by fine veins on the cotton leaf. In some cases, the spots on the leaf blade may spread along the major leaf veins. As disease progresses, these lesions gradually turn into brown, necrotic areas. The infection of stems results in black cankers that grow around the vascular tissues and girdle them, causing the portions above the canker to die and premature defoliation of the plant. A white waxy crust containing the bacterium may form on old leaf spots or cankers. Bolls may become infected causing boll rot, rotted seeds and discolored lint. Infected bolls have round, rather than angular, lesions that initially may appear water-soaked. As the infection proceeds, bolls lesions will be sunken and dark brown or black.",

    "symptoms": "The primary symptom of cotton leaf curl virus is the upward curling of leaves. Additionally, leaf veins can thicken and darken, and outgrowths (enactions) may form on the undersides of leaves, typically in the shape of leaves. Flowers may stay closed and then drop along with the bolls. If plants are infected early in the season, their growth will be stunted and yield will be reduced significantly.",
